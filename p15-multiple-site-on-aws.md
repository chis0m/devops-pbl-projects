# AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

AIM: Cost, Security, and Scalability are the major requirements for this project. Hence, implementing the architecture designed below, ensure that infrastructure for both websites, WordPress and Tooling, is resilient to Web Serverâ€™s failures, can accommodate increased traffic and at the same time, has reasonable cost.

## Summary
To achieve our above aim we will need
- Domain Name Service(Route53)
- Virtual Network with access to internet (Virtual Private Cloud with Internet Gateway - VPC and IG)
- Bastion Hosts (Jump Box)
- Proxy Servers (using Nginx)
- NAT Gateway (NGW)
- Load Balancers(Application Load Balancer - ALB)
- Automatic scalers (Auto Scaling Groups - ASG)
- EFS server (if WebServer is Worpress)
- Databse with Read Replica (Aurora) - both Tooling and Wordpress access this
  
We will setup a VPC with 2 Availability Zones, 8 Subnets(2 Public and 6 Private), 2 ALBs (1 public and 1 private), 4 ASG (1 for proxy server, 1 for Bastion and 2 for the webservers i.e 1 for Tooling and 1 for Wordpress app).

#### HTTP Traffic FLow
`Internet -> Route53 -> Internet Gateway -> Public ALB (with Listener on port 80/443)-> ASG Target Groups (Housing Proxy Servers) -> The Proxy Servers -> Private ALB -> ASG(Housing Webservers) -> The WebServers -> Database or EFS`

### SSH Traffic
`localhost -> Bastion -> Proxy Servers and Webservers`

### Network Address Translation (NAT) Traffic flow
`Webservers and ProxyServers -> NGW(in public subnet) -> Internet`


Tags are Important
- Case: CamelCase plus Kebab-Case
- Pattern: <Project>-<OwningResource(optional)>-<Resource> e.g MC-Wordpress-SG, MC-ExtALB-SG
- Environment: Dev, Test, Prod

### Steps

#### VPC
- IP: 10.0.0.0/16

#### 8 Subnets
In the 2 Public Subnets (1 for each AZ) we will have
- Name: `MC-PublicSubnets` (1 & 2)
- IP: 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24
- The bastion hosts
- 1 ASG
- 1 public ALB
- 1 NGW

In 2 Private subnet (1 for each AZ), we will have
- Name: `MC-ProxyPrivateSubnet`(1 & 2)
- IP: 10.0.3.0/24  and 10.0.4.0/24 
- The 2 proxys servers
- 1 ASG

In 2 Private subnet (1 for each AZ), we will have
- Name: `MC-WebServerPrivateSubnet` (1 & 2)
- IP: 10.0.5.0/24 and 10.0.6.0/24 
- The Webservers (Tooling and Wordpress)
- 2 ASG (1 for each type of the webservers)
- 1 ALB

In 2 Private subnet (1 for each AZ), we will have
- Name: `MC-DatabasePrivateSubnet` (1 & 2)
- IP: 10.0.7.0/24 and 10.0.8.0/24 
- The dabases - Write in one AZ and Read Replica in another AZ

#### Gateways
- Name: `MC-IGW`
- Create Internet and Nat gate ways (IGW and NAT)
- Attach IGW to the Public Route Table
- Attach NAT GW to the route table to be connected to Proxy and Webserver Subnet
Internet Gateway
- Will be attached to (specified in) the RouteTable which is associated with the 2 PublicSubnets
Nate Gateway
- Name: `MC-NATGW`
- The NGW will be hosted in any of the public subnets but will be attached to (specified in) the RouteTable which is associated with the 2 ProxyPrivateSubnet and 2 WebServerPrivateSubnet. In other words, the above 4 subnets will be associated to same routetable. This is because devices in this subnets needs to have `one-way` traffic to the internet for updates and downloading packages.
- Allocate Elastic IP
- Destination: 0.0.0.0, Target: nat-created

#### Route Tables (RT)
Public RT
- IGW: Desitination - 0.0.0.0, Target - IGW
- local

Proxy and Webserver RT
- NATGW: Destination - 0.0.0.0, Target - NAT
- local

Database RT
- local: Destination - 10.0.0.0/16, Target - local

#### Security Groups
Bastion SG
- Name: `MC-Bastion-SG`
- Allow IPs of all DevOps Engineers or if you have a VPN, whitelist its IP
- For instance run `curl www.canhazip.com` to get your public IP and then whitelist it
- Note: Ensure your IP is static unless you are using a VPN IP

Public ALB SG
- Name: `MC-PublicALB-SG`
- HTTP/HTTPS: Allow from 0.0.0.0 (internet)

Proxy server SG
- Name: `MC-ProxyServer-SG`
- Allow SSH traffic from Bastion SG
- Allow HTTP and HTTPS from ALB SG

Private ALB SG
- Name: `MC-PrivateALB-SG`
- HTTP and HTTPS: Allow access from Proxy Server SG

Webserver SG
- Name: `MC-Webserver-SG`
- Allow SSH traffic from Bastion SG
- Allow HTTP and HTTPS from Private ALB SG

#### Bastion Launch Template, ASG, Target Group#
Bastion Launch Template
- Select ubuntu AMI
- Select key pair
- Subnet: You don't need to specify but if you want to then - Select `MC-PublicSubnet 1` Subnet. The other will be set when configuring ASG using this Template
- Security Group - Select `MC-Bastion-SG`
- Add Tags
- Leave everything else as default
  
Bastion ASG
- Select Bastion Launch template
- Select the two public subnets
- Select `No Load Balancer`. But if we are to need a load balancer, it would be a Network Load balancer since Bastion for to SSH access into Private resource
- Leave everything else as default
- After create, if the Bastion doesnt have a public IP, then it means you forgot to check the `Enable Auto-assign public Ip` in your public subnet settings

#### Target Groups

Target Groups for Proxy Server
- Name: `MC-ProxyServer-TG`
- TG type should be `instances`
- Select correct VPC
- Add tags
- Leave everyother thing as default

Webserver Tooling Target Group
- Name: `MC-ToolingAppServer-TG`
- Target Type: Select Instances
- Select correct VPC
- Add tags
- Leave everything as default

Webserver WordPress Target Group
- Name: `MC-WordpressAppServer-TG`
- Target Type: Select Instances
- Select correct VPC
- Add tags
- Leave everything as default

#### Load Balancers

Public/Internet Facing ALB
- Name: `MC-PublicLB-ALB`
- Configure it to listen on ports 80 and 443
- Select `internet facing`
- Select correct VPC
- Subnet: Slect the 2 AZs and` MC-PublicSubnet 1& 2` respectively
- Security Group: Select the `MC-PublicALB SG`
- Point port 80/443 to `MC-ProxyServer-TG`. But 443 will need SSL cert configuration so for now you can ignore it
- Leave everything as default
- Create LB
- 
Webserver Private ALB
- Name: `MC-WebserverInternal-ALB`
- Select `internal`
- Select correct VPC
- Subnet: Slect the 2 AZs and`MC-WebserverPrivateSubnet 1 & 2` respectively
- Security Group: Select the `MC-Webserver-SG`
- Point port 80 to `MC-WordpressAppServer-TG`. 443 will need SSL cert configuration so for now you can ignore it
- Leave everything as default
- Create LB
- After creation go and edit the listener and add the following rules.
- Forward Traffic: HTTP 80 -> Webserver Target Group
  - Create a rule: `Host Header` - tooling.app.<domain>.com -> THEN Tooling App Target Group
  - Create a rule: `Host Header` - wordpress.app.<domain>.com -> THEN Wordpress App Target Group
  - Default rule: `If Requests otherwise not routed` -> THEN 503: Oops, I think you are lost


Create an AMI Image of the proxy ser
- Create the EC2 instance with RedHat OS
- SSH into the server and 
- Install Nginx
  
```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
sudo yum install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
sudo yum install -y nginx git
sudo systemctl restart nginx
ssudo systemctl enable nginx

# Configure Nginx
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf
```
- Add the following rule

```nginx

# Also comment out the default nginx server block

...

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name www.tooling.app.chisomejim.click;
        location / {
            proxy_pass internal-MC-WebserversPrivate-ALB-1362305892.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name www.wordpress.app.chisomejim.click;
        location / {
            proxy_pass internal-MC-WebserversPrivate-ALB-1362305892.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }
    }

...    

```
- Creat an AMI Image


#### Proxy Server Launch Template and ASG

Proxy Server Launch Template
- Name: `MC-ProxyServer-LT`
- We will use the Launch Template when creating the Proxy server ASG
- Use the Proxy Server Custom AMI created above or you can use a fresh Redhat AMI and t2.medium
- Choose your keypair
- Take Note: In an ideal situation this ssh keypair is only used by the master engineer. Everyother engineer would have their own public keep populated across the server. Here `ansible, puppet, chef config managers` can help with this
- Select subnet as `MC-ProxyServerSubnet 1`. When creating ASG we will also specify the second subnet, by that we would scale across the two AZs
- Select Security group as the `MC-ProxyServer-SG` earlier created
- Add Tags
- Leave everything else as default

Note: When you make changes to your Lauch template and a new version is created, always remember to pick `Later version` not default in the version section

Proxy Server ASG
- Choose the `MC-ProxyServer-LT` and Version should be `Latest(n)` where n is the latest number
- Select the VPC
- Select subnets `MC-ProxyServerSubnet 1 & 2`
- Attach existing Load Balancer. Choose the Public/Internet Facing Load Balancer
- **Note:** In attaching a Load Balancer to an ASG, it is actually the Target Group the Load balancer is forwarding-to that you are choosing
- Group Seize: Minimum - 1, Desired Capacity/Maximum - 2
- Scaling Policies: Metric Type -> CPU, Target Value -> 70

#### AMI for Tooling and Webserver

AMI for Tooling and Wordpress Webservers
- Create RedHat EC2 instance
- Install Nginx with same instructions for Proxy Server
- For demo purposes, Create a HTML content you like and paste in `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`. However you can go further and setup an actually app 
- Create AMI for each `MC-ToolingApp-AMI` and `MC-WordpressApp-AMI`


#### Lauch Templates and ASG for the Webservers
Tooling and Wordpress Web Server Launch Template (LT)
- Name: `MC-ToolingApp-LT` and `MC-WordpressApp-LT`
- Do same for each accordingly. Same subnet though
- Select Wordpress(Tooling, if tooling LT) AMI
- Select key pair
- Select `MC-WebserverPrivateSubnet 1` Subnet. The other will be set when configuring ASG using this Template
- Security Group - Select `MC-Webserver-SG`
- Add Tags
- Leave everything else as default

Tooling and Wordpress ASG
- Name: `MC-ToolingApp-ASG` and `MC-WordpressApp-ASG`
- Do same for both accordingly
- Choose the `MC-WordpressApp-LT` or `MC-ToolingApp-LT` accordingly
- Select the VPC
- Select same subnets `MC-WebserverPrivateSubnet 1 & 2`
- Attach existing Load Balancer. Choose the `MC-WebserverInternal-ALB`, select `MC-ToolingApp-TG` or `MC-WordpressApp-TG` accordingly
- Group Seize: Desired Capacity/Minimum - 1, Maximum - 3
- Scaling Policies: Metric Type -> CPU, Target Value -> 70


#### Domain Setup
Route53 
- will resolve the Domain name.
- Create a CNAME to point to the public ALB DNS address
- You can visit `dnschecker.org` to very your the cname works appropriately
- If you bought domains from third party (lets use namecheap), then
  - Click `create hosted zones` and fill up the following
  - Domain Name:  domain you paid for e.g `chisomejim.click`
  - Type: choose Public hosted zone and create
  - Two records will be created. NS(Name servers) and SOA to be mapped to the Domain Name in namecheap
  - Copy Name Server values and paste in namecheaps Domain `Manage -> Nameserver -> Custom DNS`


### Possible Errors
- On using RedHat Based Distros of Proxy Server, you might get this error `(13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream`
- Solution: execute `sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1` on the proxy server. At this point you might want to rebuild a new AMI image with this comand executed already


#### Part 2
- Setup Database Servers in `MC-Default-Subnet`
- EFS Setup in `MC-WebserverPrivate-Subnet 1 & 2` must be in same subnet as the application connecting to it
- Actually wordpress App installation and connection to EFS
- TLS Certificate
